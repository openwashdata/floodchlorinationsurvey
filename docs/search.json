Potential Use Cases WASH Program Monitoring Evaluation Track impact rehabilitation efforts water point functionality. Monitor effectiveness chlorination flood-prone regions. Infrastructure Asset Management Identify components frequently requiring replacement. Schedule preventive maintenance prioritize resources. Disaster Response Planning Map flood-affected water infrastructure assess repair timelines. Use historical damage repair data prepare future climate shocks. Public Health Risk Assessment Analyze relationship water source integrity contamination risks (e.g., proximity latrines cemeteries). Policy Program Design Guide government donor decisions invest resilient rural water systems. Training Capacity Building Use data photos case studies training technicians water committees.
